## The Prompt Request Pattern

This project follows the **Prompt Request** contribution model. Instead of hand-writing hundreds of lines of code for line-by-line review, contributors describe their **intent** — what they want to achieve — and use an AI coding agent to generate the implementation.

**How it works:**

1. Open a GitHub issue describing the desired outcome (this is your "prompt request")

2. Pick up an approved issue, feed it to your coding agent as a prompt, iterate until it works

3. Open a Pull Request that includes the **literal prompt(s)** you used alongside the generated code

**Why this model:**

- Maintainers review **intent and architecture alignment**, not syntax
- Contributors focus on **what** (product goals, constraints, acceptance criteria) rather than **how** (implementation details)
- The prompt trail creates **reproducibility** — anyone can re-run the same intent to understand or modify the output
- This is especially powerful for contributors who are new to code: you describe what you want in plain language and the agent helps you build it

Traditional code contributions are also accepted, but Pull Requests must still include a description of the intent and any prompts used during development.

## Opening an Issue (Prompt Request)

Open a GitHub issue describing the desired outcome clearly. Think of the issue body as a prompt you would give to a capable colleague. It should state the problem or goal, the relevant context, and any constraints.

A good prompt request includes:

- **What** you want to happen (desired outcome, not implementation steps)
- **Which skill or area** it affects
- **Why** it matters (the use case or problem you are solving)
- **Constraints** (e.g., must support Tableau Cloud and Server, must not break existing API, etc.)

**Good example:**

> "Add support for workbook-level filtering to the query skill. Users should be able to pass a filter parameter when querying a published datasource so the agent can narrow results before retrieving them. This would reduce query payload size on large datasources."

**Bad example:**

> "Fix bug." (no context, no desired outcome, no skill specified)

## Submitting a Pull Request

Before opening a PR, make sure there's an associated issue that describes the intent. The PR is the artifact; the issue is the prompt.

### What to include in your PR description

1. **Reference the issue** — `Closes #<issue-number>`

2. **The literal prompt(s)** you gave to your agent (the "prompt trail")

3. **What changed** — a brief summary of what the agent produced

4. **Any manual edits** — what you changed after the agent generated the code

### Example PR body

```markdown
Closes #42


**Prompt used:**
> "Add a `filter_project` parameter to `Session.inventory_datasources()`
> so agents can scope catalog discovery to a single Tableau project.
> The parameter should accept a project name string and pass it as a
> query parameter to the REST API. Update the return type and add a test."


**What changed:**
- Added `filter_project: str | None = None` to `inventory_datasources()`
- Passed it through to the REST API query parameters
- Added a test in `tests/test_inventory.py`


**Manual edits:**
- The agent initially used `urllib.parse.quote` which double-encoded spaces.
 I switched to `requests` parameter handling which the SDK already uses.
```

### PR checklist

Before submitting your PR, verify:

- [ ] Tests pass (`uv run pytest`)
- [ ] The PR includes the prompt(s) used to generate the code
- [ ] Documentation reflects your changes (README.md, SKILL.md, docs/)
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive
- [ ] You have not committed credentials, `.env` files, or `temp/` output

## Git Basics

If you are new to Git, here is the workflow, step by step.

### 1. Fork the repository

Click the **Fork** button on the [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/Action-Co/skills) to create your own copy under your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone your fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/skills.git && cd skills
```

### 3. Create a new branch

Always work on a branch — never commit directly to `main`.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-change-name
```

Good branch names describe the change: `feature/snowflake-basics`, `fix/tableau-auth-timeout`, `docs/repl-examples`.

### 4. Make your changes

Edit files using your preferred editor or coding agent.

### 5. Stage and commit

```bash
# See what you changed
git status


# Add the files you changed
git add <file-path>
# Or add all changes in the current directory
git add .


# Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "add filter_project parameter to inventory_datasources"
```

Commit messages should be concise and describe **what** changed and **why**:

- Good: `add filter_project parameter to inventory_datasources`
- Good: `fix: handle 401 on datasource introspection gracefully`
- Bad: `updates` (too vague)
- Bad: `fixed stuff` (no information)

### 6. Push your branch

```bash
git push origin feature/your-change-name
```

### 7. Open a Pull Request

Go to the [original repository page](https://github.com/Action-Co/skills) on GitHub. You will see a banner prompting you to open a Pull Request for your branch. Click it, fill in the PR description following the template above, and submit.

# Install dependencies
uv sync --all-extras


# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate


# Run tests
uv run pytest
```

## Skill Structure Conventions

Each skill is a self-contained package. When adding or modifying a skill follow this layout:

```text
plugins/<plugin>/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json        # only plugin.json lives inside .claude-plugin/
└── skills/
    └── <skill-name>/
        ├── SKILL.md       # agent entry point
        ├── README.md
        ├── docs/
        ├── scripts/
        ├── temp/          # gitignored
        └── src/
```

- **`README.md`** — Human-facing: skill overview, design rationale, setup instructions (especially HITL steps), and links to deeper docs
- **`SKILL.md`** — Agent-facing: entry point with workflow instructions, traversal patterns, and links to `docs/`
- **`docs/`** — Deep-dive material that agents pull as needed. Keep the README and SKILL.md as entry points, not monolithic dumps
- **Use `uv`** for dependency management and script execution
- **No dev dependencies in skill `pyproject.toml`** — test dependencies live at the workspace root

---

## Coding Standards

- **Python**: Write clean, typed code. Prefer explicit over clever. Add docstrings for public functions
- **Error handling**: Raise typed exceptions with actionable messages. Agents self-debug from these
- **Logging**: Use structured logging where appropriate. Agents read logs to diagnose issues
- **Tests**: New code should have tests. We follow red-green TDD when practical
- **Documentation**: Update both `README.md` and `SKILL.md` if your change affects the public interface or workflow
