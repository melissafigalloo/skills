Built by **[The Action Company](https://action.co)**, an interdependent consultancy that helps organizations make better decisions in complex, fast-moving environments. We partner with data and leadership teams that are surrounded by information and seeking clarity. Through advanced analytics, applied AI, and conscious leadership, we help transform fragmented details into shared understanding, decisive action, and decision systems that enable teams to spot patterns sooner, align on what matters, and adapt to changing conditions.

## Why Agent Skills?

Most AI agents can query a database. Few can navigate the semantic layers, business logic, and curated data models that teams have already built on top of it.

These skills bridge that gap. They are [**CodeAct**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01030) implementations — lightweight SDKs, documentation, and working code that agents import and execute directly. This gives agents:

- **Composition through control flow** — loop over catalogs, filter results programmatically, and chain operations in a single code block
- **Self-debugging through execution feedback** — observe typed exceptions, read error messages, and correct the next attempt without human intervention
- **Persistent state through variables** — hold catalog metadata, schemas, and query results as objects across turns, referencing them by name rather than re-fetching

For large enterprise environments, agents use **REPL-based state management** to decompose discovery into sequential steps (scope → inventory → lineage → introspection), loading catalog data into variables and printing only counts and filtered summaries. This keeps the context window lean — O(1) — while the agent does `O(n)` semantic work across the entire site. Research on [Recursive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601) shows that managing large inputs as REPL variables rather than loading them into the context window is key to scaling beyond context limits; this skill applies that same principle at the agent level without recursive model sub-calling. For a fully recursive implementation, see [alexzhang13/rlm](https://github.com/alexzhang13/rlm). Individual harnesses implement recursion differently — some use sub-agent delegation, others use the REPL alone.

For a deeper look at why composable, code-first agent tooling outperforms monolithic platform approaches, see our article on [The Real Meaning of Headless BI](https://action.co/the-real-meaning-of-headless-bi).
